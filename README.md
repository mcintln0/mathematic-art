Python programs to make art based on mathematic principles

I like to make art but getting the details and measurements necessary are difficult to do by hand. Creating rough sketches with python helps me remember the nuances of the language and is fun. So enjoy! If it's useful to you as well, glad I could be of assistance.

FibonacciArt.py
Used modules: turtle, random, time (random and time are not necessary for the function itself and are only used for generating examples)
Program makes a series of concentric half circles, with increasing distances based on the fibnocacci sequence and can optionally be connected at a given angle.
